# Controle Financeiro - Flutter conversion
This is a Flutter project skeleton generated by ChatGPT to approximate the layout you provided.
It uses assets placed in assets/images/ as placeholders for charts/screenshots.

How to run:
1. Ensure Flutter SDK is installed and added to PATH.
2. In IntelliJ: Open -> Open Directory -> select this project's folder.
3. Run `flutter pub get` and then run the app.

Notes:
- This is a UI approximation. You can replace images with dynamic charts using fl_chart.
- pubspec.yaml already lists fl_chart and google_fonts.
